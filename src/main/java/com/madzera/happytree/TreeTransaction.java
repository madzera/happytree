/**
 * Dedicated interface to handle all stored tree sessions. It is responsible to
 * handle sessions in the API.
 * 
 * <p>With the transaction, the API client can initialize, deactivate, activate,
 * retrieve or destroy any sessions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Structurally, this interface acts as a bridge between the 
 * {@link TreeManager} and the {@link TreeSession}, making inherent part of
 * session, handling the total responsibility of this class, leaving the
 * <code>TreeManager</code> interface free to just manipulate the elements
 * inside of the session.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An {@link Element} represents a node in a tree and a tree can only exist
 * within a previously created session. But to create a session, it is needed to
 * use an object that represents the session transaction, and this object is an
 * instance of this interface. However, a transaction only can be recovered from
 * within the <code>TreeManager</code> by invoking
 * {@link TreeManager#getTransaction()}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There are two ways of creating tree sessions:</p>
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Create a new empty tree session;</li>
 * 		<li>Create a tree session from the <b>API Transformation Process</b>.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
 * 
 * <p>The first one happens when the API client just wants create a default
 * empty tree session by invoking {@link #initializeSession(String, Class)}.
 * Here an empty tree is created, specifying which type of class this session
 * will have as node.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The last one happens when an API client desire to transform a 
 * <code>Collection</code> of objects that represents a linear tree structure.
 * This transformation (which is called by API Transformation Process) converts
 * this linear structure into a real tree structure, which each node is
 * represented by an <code>Element</code> objects. This API Transformation
 * Process implements an internal life cycle.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>The <code>TreeTransaction</code> can only work with one
 * <code>TreeSession</code> per time, meanwhile the other sessions stay in
 * background waiting to be selected again in another time.</b></p>

	 * 		<li><b>Core Engine (with 3 sub-phases)</b></li>
	 * 	</ol>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Note: The concept of sub-phase is merely illustrative and serves
	 * only to distinguish the phases of validations from the phases of the tree
	 * transformation process.</b></p>
	 * 
	 * 	<table summary="ATP Lifecycle">
	 * 		<tr>
	 * 			<th>Phase</th><th>Description</th><th>Sub-Phases</th>
	 * 		</tr>
	 * 		<tr>
	 * 			<td>Pre-Validation</td><td>Validates each input object

	 * 	</table>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Pre-Validation:</b></p>
	 * <p>This phase represents the begin of the API Transformation Process. In
	 * this phase, the core API needs that all inputs aspects to be transformed
	 * need to conform. The following validations are done:</p>
	 * 
	 * 	<ul>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the list of objects to be transformed is not
	 * 		<code>null</code> or empty;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether there is an existing session with the same
	 * 		identifier;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the class of the objects to be transformed is
	 * 		annotated with {@code @Tree} annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the identifier attribute of the object to be
	 * 		transformed has the	{@code @Id} annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the parent attribute of the object to be
	 * 		transformed has the {@code @Parent} annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the identifier attribute of each object is
	 * 		<code>null</code>;</li>
	 * 		<li>Validates whether all source objects have all of them the
	 * 		{@code @Id} and {@code @Parent} attributes with the same class
	 * 		type;</li>
	 * 		<li>Checks for duplicate {@code @Id};</li>
	 * 		<li>Verifies whether the class of the objects to be transformed has
	 * 		getters and setters.</li>
	 * 	</ul>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Core Engine:</b></p>
	 * <p><i>Extraction:</i></p>
	 * <p>If the input represented by the list of objects to be transformed
	 * passed all validations from the previous phase, then the HappyTree API
	 * takes them and extracts them in order to separate them from their
	 * respective parents. Therefore, as a product for the next phase, there
	 * will be the objects and their respective parents separated into two
	 * blocks.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><i>Initialization:</i></p>
	 * <p>In this phase, the HappyTree API instantiates an object of type
	 * {@link Element} for each source object used as input and passes the
	 * respective {@code @Id} and {@code @Parent} attributes of the source
	 * object to that element. In addition, the source object itself is
	 * automatically wrapped into that element, thus making the source object
	 * liable to be a tree node, since the element naturally represents a node
	 * in the context of the HappyTree API. After the tree is built, to retrieve
	 * the source object just invoke the {@link Element#unwrap()} method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><i>Binding:</i></p>
	 * <p>After obtaining the list of resulting elements from the previous phase,
	 * the HappyTree API will now bind each element to its respective parent,
	 * through the block of separated parent objects in the Extraction phase.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Therefore, it is at this phase that the tree is actually assembled.
	 * Thus, for each node in the tree we have a represented element object,
	 * where each element has:</p>
	 * 
	 * 	<ul>
	 * 		<li>The {@code @Id} attribute value;</li>
	 * 		<li>The {@code @Parent} attribute value;</li>
	 * 		<li>The <code>wrappedNode</code> corresponding the source object
	 * 		used in this process;</li>
	 * 		<li>The collection of <code>children</code>, corresponding to other
	 * 		elements in which they are children of this;</li>
	 * 		<li>The tree <code>session</code>, which this element belongs.</li>
	 * 	</ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>this life cycle is only triggered in the <b>API Transformation
	 * Process</b>, by invoking this method, passing a collection of a linear
	 * structure to be transformed (<code>nodes</code>).</p>
