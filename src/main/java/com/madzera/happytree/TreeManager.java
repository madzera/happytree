/**
 * Provides ways of handling elements within the tree session. With this, turn
 * on possible to create, persist, update, cut, copy, remove, retrieve elements
 * and any other operations within the tree.
 * 
 * <p>This interface works directly handling objects represented by the 
 * {@link Element} interface, where each one behaves similarly to a node within 
 * the tree. So, In practical terms, this interface allows the API client to 
 * handle business objects with tree-like behavior similar to
 * <i>JavaScript DOM</i>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The operations here are done for elements within others or for "roots" 
 * elements. The roots elements are considered to be those that are not inside
 * of other elements, but those that are at the "top" of the tree hierarchy in 
 * question. When the tree is created, automatically its root also are created,
 * with this root being empty or having various children.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The operations also are done for cases where this is desirable reallocate
 * elements for inside of other trees sessions. In this case, the oneness of
 * each element must be respected, related to the tree which elements will be
 * inside.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is important to note that there are two distinct and well-defined
 * contexts in the HappyTree API. The inside and outside contexts. When the
 * API client obtains an element and its children through the manager, the
 * API client is actually working with identical copies of each node (element).
 * When the API client makes any changes to any of the elements, a change in the
 * element's life cycle is made, and this change is not immediately reflected in
 * the tree in question. This context is called outside of the tree. An inside
 * context represents the client's action to perform the persist/update of the
 * element, so the change is actually reflected in the tree, but made through
 * this manager itself. The persist/update operations work by invoking the
 * {@link TreeManager#persistElement(Element)} and
 * {@link #updateElement(Element)} respectively.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Conceptually, this interface works by handling trees through a transaction.
 * This transaction is represented by the {@link TreeTransaction} interface and
 * the relation between both interfaces is 1:1. Therefore, this interface will
 * always be linked to a single transaction, which can contain no one or many
 * sessions, but this is only possible to handle one session at the time.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The API client must be sure to handle elements through their respective
 * transactions. A simple swap of a tree, by a transaction, makes this manager
 * ready to deal with a totally different tree.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For operations to work, the following validations are made:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>The transaction must have a session binded, <b>always</b>.</li>
 * 		<li>This is <b>mandatory</b> that the session be <b>activated.</b></li>
 * 		<li>
 * 			According with the method, the elements must have in the proper
 * 			state.
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>for each tree session, each element inside must have unique id.</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 			An element cannot be handle within trees which have different
 * 			types of wrapped nodes.
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>This is not possible to handle roots elements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>If one of these validations fail, an exception will be thrown.</p>
