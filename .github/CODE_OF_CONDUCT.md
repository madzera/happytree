# Code of Conduct

## Objective

Following the Open-Source atmosphere, this code of conduct aims to define
recommendations in order to guarantee the freedom of collaborators to
contribute, suggest and make use of the HappyTree API, in order to respect
all members of this community, making spontaneously the environment conducive to
technological and personal development.

## Behavior Standards

The HappyTree community, living up to its name, believes that its members are
mature enough to have common sense, thus ensuring a community that values full
inclusion, respect and a spirit of collaboration with their fellow humans. The
HappyTree Community is inspired by the purest behaviors of the Open-Source
spirit, that are: free integration among members, spontaneous collaboration and
mutual assistance between members, based on the pillars of respect and common
sense.

Here are some recommendations for keeping the community environment pleasant:

* Be respectful of the different points of view and previous experiences;
* Express a point respectfully so as not to verbally attack others;
* Be able to criticize as well as receive criticism in a respectful manner;
* Stimulate learning;
* Show empathy and patience with new members who do not yet know the spirit of
  the community.
 
The following are examples of behaviors that are not community standards:

* Use of sexual language;
* Defamatory comments;
* Verbal aggressions/insults;
* Publication of private content or information without the express consent;
* Discrimination under any aspect towards others;
* Any other conduct that deviates from ethical and moral principles.

## Enforcement

If a member feels offended, they can report such occurrence through the
following email: contact@madzera.com.

The affected person in question can be sure that their report will be analyzed
confidentially and in a totally impartial manner in light of the facts found.
Warnings may be given to the aggressor and, if their behavior remains
incompatible with the community's code of conduct, the aggressor may be expelled
from it.

The HappyTree community believes that these actions will never be executed,
precisely because it believes in the good faith of the members.
