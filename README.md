## About the HappyTree API

### What is it?

HappyTree is a data structure API designed for the Java programming 
language that consists of transforming linear objects into a tree 
structure, where each object represents a node in the tree and can 
have none or several other objects of the same type.

In addition to the **Transformation Process** (mechanism to
transform this linear structure of objects into a tree structure),
the HappyTree API provides mechanisms to handle these objects within
trees, as if these objects were tree nodes, all in an easy and
intuitive way.

### What is your purpose?

The HappyTree API has three main purposes:

<ol>
<li>Handle <b>Java Objects</b> as if they were nodes within trees, in
 order to perform operations such as copying, cutting, removing,
 creating, persisting or updating;</li>
<li>Transform linear data structures of <b>Java Objects</b> into
 trees;</li>
 <li>Create and manage multiple trees of these objects.</li>
</ol>

The first purpose represents the basic operations in the trees, when
the API client desires to change the state of the nodes (officially
called of **Elements** in the context of the API) in the trees, in
order to move, copy, remove, create and update those nodes.

The second purpose is suitable for situations in which the API client
needs to transform a collection of plain objects of which there is a
tree logical relation between them, but that they are not being
represented structurally as a tree.

The last one allows the API client to activate, deactivate or destroy
the trees.

### For who?

For developers who feel the need to work with trees on their
**Java Object Model**. The HappyTree API only acts on the
**Object Model Layer** of a project's architecture.

### When to use?

When the API client has a data structure which the logical represents
a tree but its objects are only linearly referenced to each other,
this API has precisely this purpose of transforming the linear
structure into a physical tree structure, beyond of providing
mechanisms to handle them.

If, for example, the API client has a directory structure in its 
system, or if it needs to assemble a screen of visual components, 
through objects that are not inside each other, but objects that 
refer others through simple attributes, then this is the right 
opportunity to use the HappyTree API, since objects will now be
inside each other thus like a tree, as well as offering interfaces
to handle them.

<b>If you have something like this:</b><br>

```java
//Linear tree structure.  
public class Directory {
	//Own ID
	private Integer dirId;
	//Super node reference
	private Integer dirParentId;
	//Simple attribute
	private String dirName;
	
	//getters and setters
}  
```

<b>But you want this:</b><br>

```java
//Recursive tree structure wrapped through the Element object.
public class Element<Directory> {
	private Object dirId;
	private Object dirParentId;
	private Collection<Element<Directory>> subDirs;
	
	//Skeleton methods.
	public void addChild(Element<Directory> child);
	
	public void removeChild(Element<Directory> child);
	
	public void wrap(Directory directory);
	
	public Directory unwrap();
}
```

### How to use?

If you want to do something described above, that is, using the
HappyTree API to transform a linear structure into a tree structure,
you must first add the following annotations to the **Java Class**
to which its objects will be inserted as a tree node:

```java
//Linear tree structure.
@Tree
public class Directory {
	@Id
	private Integer dirId;
	@Parent
	private Integer dirParentId;
	//Simple attribute
	private String dirName;
	
	//getters and setters
}
```

After that, just group these objects into a collection.

A tree can be created either through the **Transformation Process**
of a previously available linear structure or be created freely
through an empty tree.

For the case of the **Transformation Process**, the initialization is
something similar to the code below:

```java
	Collection<Directory> directories = myObject.myMethodToGetDirectories();
	TreeManager manager = HappyTree.createTreeManager();
	TreeTransaction transaction = manager.getTransaction();
	transaction.initializeSession("myFirstHappyTree", directories);
```

To initialize an empty tree, the code snippet looks something like
the code below:

```java
	TreeManager manager = HappyTree.createTreeManager();
	TreeTransaction transaction = manager.getTransaction();
	transaction.initializeSession("mySecondHappyTree", Directory.class);
```

Once created, the trees start to work on
[Element](./src/main/java/com/madzera/happytree/Element.java)
type objects, which will encapsulate (wrap) the "original objects"
(Directory) represented as the respective nodes. From there, just use the
[TreeManager](./src/main/java/com/madzera/happytree/TreeManager.java)
interface to handle these elements.

### Requirements


Because it acts on a specific layer of the architecture of a
**Java Project**, the HappyTree API has a very limited list of
requirements, so in addition to being easy to use, the HappyTree API
also has an easy installation.

Both to make use of, as well as to contribute, the requirements are:

* **Java 8**;
* **Maven 3.6.x**;
* **The Java and Maven environment variables must be well configured ($JAVA_HOME, $MAVEN_HOME and $PATH).**
* **SonarLint**: It is optional, but highly recommended to fix code
 issues.

### Dependencies

The HappyTree API has only one dependency, which is used to perform
unit tests:

* **JUnit 4.13.1**.

### Code structure

HappyTree API is structured into different directories:

- [`src/main`](./src/main/java/com/madzera/happytree): API code.
- [`src/test`](./src/test/java/com/madzera/happytree): JUnit test code.

### Coding

* [HappyTree API coding standards](/.github/coding/CODING_STANDARDS.md)
* [Writing tests](/.github/coding/WRITING_TESTS.md)
* [Checklist](/.github/coding/CHECKLIST.md)

### Build

For building, go to the project root folder and enter the following
command:

```mvn
mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip=true
```
